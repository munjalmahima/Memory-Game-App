# Memory-Game-App
Memory Game App build in Android Studio

In this game app, the screen is divided into a grid of 4* 4 matrix which displays 16 images. The player can click/tap on these images which would cause the image to flip for a few seconds. The player has to remember this image in that time span and search for the same image in the grid. If he clicks on two same images consecutively, his score increases by 1.
